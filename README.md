1. Project Overview:
This project aims to enhance conspicuity detection within production processes,
enabling the early identification of improvement opportunities for individual work steps or sub-processes.
By doing so, we seek to optimize the overall production workflow. We analyze process data such as image data or time series,
to identify deviations and weaknesses in the production process. Traditional methods for analyzing such data are often very time-consuming.
To address this, our project explores the potential of hybrid quantum computing to accelerate the analysis process. Our primary focus is
on implementing the necessary hybrid quantum algorithms and rigorously benchmarking their performance against classical approaches,
including machine learning and statistical methods.
